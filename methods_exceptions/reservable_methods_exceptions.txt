Reservable class methods and their exceptions (from modules/reservable.py)
=========================================================================

1. reserved_by (property getter) - Abstract
   - Exceptions: None (abstract method, implementation depends on subclass)

2. reserve(self, user) - Abstract
   - Exceptions: None (abstract method, implementation depends on subclass)

Notes:
------
- This is an abstract base class (ABC) that defines the interface for reservable objects.
- All methods are abstract and don't raise exceptions themselves.
- The actual exception behavior depends on the implementing classes (Book, DVD).
- The interface requires User type for the user parameter, but validation is handled by implementing classes.
